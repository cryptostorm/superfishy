Yesterday, several of us at cryptostorm made note of the work @FiloSottile and colleagues were doing over the weekend iin pursuing the threads of #superfish in an ever-widening circle.

It didn't take much convincing for us to jump back in and keep the chase afoot. We'd offered to pull together as much raw data as possible overnight, as fuel for additional refining & iteration today by others working the project.

That we have done. Those data are made available in this repository, in more-or-less current form. Which is to say a bit rumpled and ragged on the edges, but nevertheless in good spirits and ready to step it up a bit, you know?

No fancy essay here, then. Things aren't far enough along, empirically, to do that with these sub-projects we've been working. Some are quite close - cyberghost has some really unsettling code compiled into their currently-in-production "VPN client" that shouldn't be there, period.

Apart from that, things are still not ready for Lessons Learned. But, to hell with it: these #superfishy sneak-tunnels around and through https are not rare. They're somewhere between common and widespread... that's my sense of it. They've evolved mostly within the adware world, and as such they're well-funded, well-marketed, and often quite well-coded. They make people alot of money, without any obvious victimisation or picket lines or clearcut forests. People making money like that don't much prefer to let it go. It's a good gig. 

This class of ssl-kneecapper toolkits is out there. We've got one deep-dive review of a Creepy Orwell Incorporated "let's spy on our employees because hell why not" example of the class that's really nauseating. Then there's the quiet, clever little sneak-fish examples: so happy just sitting there doing their little surveillance and re-routing tasks, nothing to see here move right along.

Then there's the NSA. Don't think they're as decade ahead of the stuff we're looking at here? Well, ok - maybe 15 years ahead. That's the Megalodon under all these little fishies, trolling the deeps, categorically divergent. 

Plus anyone with a black hat background sees this stuff out loaded on client PCs and can't help but see pure, wide-open Vuln Heaven. So much wide-open code, so many bugs, so much no incentive to fix any of it on the part of the adwhores that make it. It's the perfect storm of backdoor pwnage. And it's already ramping up... or so we're told.

It took Rob a couple hours to decrypt the "private" #superfish key a few days back. I'd played with that puzzle for an hour or so, before doing the responsible thing & doing some proper work while he finished it off. Full credit to him for the 'pop, but it was trivial (as he's emphasized himself). Not really even hacking, more a larkabout, you know? And if we're larking about smart hungry folks are doing alot more than that.

Df & I popped the "encrypted" cyberghost private key in less than an hour, during which time we were both doing other tasks in parallel. There was another such private key popped by a first-time this morning with whom we're working: he took a couple hours, mostly inexperience.

So what, is the obvious question.

Yeah, problem is that with those "private" keys, anyone can sit a bump on the wire and transparently pull off active MiTMs of full-crypto https sessions coming of any machine infected with that same kneecap-ware. 

Well that's not true. Those of us with some networking miles under the belt likely can do so from the comfort of our own office cubicles a few thousand km away. Visting google? Not so much - you're visiting whoever has that private key, if they want you to.

Good times!

Anyay there's time aplenty for that. Here's some data. Most of the .exe's aren't uploaded someplace local - we'd intended some zipped archives, but got pulled off on server provisioning duties in our real lives as folks who make cryptostorm stay stormy. We'll make sure those get posted up later this evenings, so we can keep digging in.

Thanks to @FiloSottile for his (now normal) leadership role in this - a pleasure to see. And many thanks to the super-smart, crazy, fascinating folks behind the scenes adding in tidbits of genius & stochasticity in equal measure. Our kind of people.

Right, finally I owe a big apology to Ernesto at Torrentfreak. I'd given my word to have him some writing, yesterday. Not only did I not get it done, I've not actually looked at it yet. Which is awful, agreed. But... this super-fish-tastic stuff has been pretty all-encompassing. One gets in the groove (or perhaps rut) and one rolls with it... colleagues likewise moving out smartly. It's tough - and a bit dangeorous - to break the flow. So I've eschewed most all normal duties, which presents as disrespectful.

No such intent was afoot in this, Ernesto. I've stepped away from the javascript deobfuscators, and once I've re-acquainted myself with "the world" beyond packet-switched network topologies for a few hours, I am exclusively & humbly at your disposal. My regrets to have failed in keeping my earlier deadline; it is unprofessional.

Packets don't lie.

Dig in :-P

ps: @dfkt won the internet on Saturday night... just wanted to point that out again. Because he did.
